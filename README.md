Edit: I realized that the SGB variant palettes from 2A to 4H are from an older version I was working on, so they're a clone of 1A. I'm working on updating to the correct palettes atm.

﻿This is a shader to install on Retroarch to make Virtual Boy (and other monochromatic consoles) more prettier and less an eye blight.

To install this, put the root of this project on the shaders folder, and inside Retroarch go to Shaders>Load>virtual boy colorize.glslp (or VB color+scaled.glslp for color+ smoothing).

If you want to change the color, on the passes sector, select the vb\_colorize.glsl, select it to swap it, go to the shaders>other palettes> and there, you can pick Custom or Super Game Boy, and then, pick a glsl. 


This plugin is a modified version of the original by EADMASTER, but it seems like he deleted it from Github.

I’ve uploaded an explanation here https://youtu.be/a4kyWWEu7JQ (in Spanish, working on English subtitles).
